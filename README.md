# cppProgression
This is going to be a repository where i store and document all the progression i can manage to pump out during the holidays.

# classesmybeloved (i probably should've stored this in a single folder)
A simple project where i test my first genuinely functioning class ("Human") and experiment with external imports (and .h files, so my projects arent completely condensed in a single file)
